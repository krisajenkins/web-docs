# Prerequisites

While it is already possible to do a lot using the <a href="https://console.toit.io/" target="_blank">Toit console</a>, your developer experience with Toit will be improved after installing  **Visual Studio Code**.

## Visual Studio Code

Toit supports you in writing Toit program with the Toit Language Extension for Visual Studio Code.
Note that the extension is not available on VSCode Marketplace but will be installed when installing Toit as explained in [Install Toit](toitcli.md).

Note that while you can use another editor to write *.toit files, the Toit language extension is currently only supported for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.
However we do have a Language Server which works with all IDEs that support the LSP protocol.
The language server includes syntax highlighting for VIM users.
