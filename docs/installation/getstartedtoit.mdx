# Get started with Toit

There is already a lot you can do with Toit as soon as you get a user account for `toit.io`.

Access the <a href="https://console.toit.io/" target="_blank">Toit console</a> which runs in the Toit cloud to write and run Toit programs using the playground or a simulator. Both benefit from the Toit language extension that helps you get your Toit code right.

Get familiar with the Toit console [here](../console/console.md).

## Use the playground

The playground includes a terminal window where you can write a Toit program. Click on **Run online** to try it on the console. The playground uses the latest firmware installed in your organization (see Organization | SDKS).

You can try this binary search program in the playground.

```
main:
  list := List 15: it * 2
  print "Binary Search"
  print "List: $list"

  index := binary_search list 8
  print "index of 8: $index"
binary_search list needle:
  from := 0
  to := list.size
  while from < to:
    mid := from + (to - from) / 2
    if list[mid] == needle: return mid
    else if list[mid] < needle: from = mid + 1
    else if list[mid] > needle: to = mid - 1
  return -1
```

## Use a simulator

Click on the **Start a simulator** button in the Devices page to start a simulator with the firmware version of your choice. Delete a simulator by clicking on the corresponding bin icon.

Write a program in the Code tab of the simulator and click the **Run on Device** button.
