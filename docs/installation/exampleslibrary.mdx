# Examples, library and tools

## SDK-specific examples and library

You can download example programs and the Toit library from any SDK installed in your Toit console to help you get started with writing your first apps.

=== "Console"
    Go to the Download page and choose the SDK version from which you want to get the examples or the library. Unpack the folder(s) in your preferred location.

    ![sdkexandlib](../img/sdkexandlib.png)

=== "CLI"

    Download example programs and the Toit library for the newest SDK to a specified directory with the commands `toit sdk examples <dir>` and `toit sdk lib <dir>`.

    For example, download them in a `toit-examples` folder on your Desktop with 
    ```
    toit sdk examples ~/Desktop/toit-examples
    ```

    You can also download both examples and Toit libraries from older SDK versions with the suffix ` --version <vx.xx.x>` as in 
    ```
    toit sdk examples --version v0.12.0 ~/Desktop/toit-examples
    ```

In Visual Studio Code, open the folder of examples with **File | Open**. For the library, go to **File | Add Folder to Workspace...** and choose the relevant `lib` folder to access the library easily from the workspace where you write your toit programs.
