# Toit firmware

The Toit Firmware is the Toit runtime system that is installed on your hardware, on top of the OS, to enable program execution.

When your devices connect to the online Toit console, they will start upgrading their firmware over-the-air to the latest released version, if that action was initiated by a user.
The devices will also look for new applications to be installed over-the-air while connecting to the Toit console.
