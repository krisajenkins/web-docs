# Toit firmware

The Toit Firmware is the Toit runtime system that is installed on your hardware, on top of the OS, to enable program execution.

When your devices connect to the online Toit console, they will look for new firmware updates and applications to be installed over-the-air on the devices.

Get an overview of the device models currently present in the Toit firmware [here](../models). 

The available peripherals are described [here](../peripherals/gpio).
