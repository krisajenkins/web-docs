# Connect your hardware

Before you can start interacting with your hardware in the Toit console, it must be provisioned and claimed.

Provisioning means that the hardware is being granted a hardware ID used for the remaining of its lifecycle, and the latest released Toit firmware will be installed on the hardware.

During the provisioning process, the initial WiFi settings for the hardware is set, but additional connection settings can be added later on or changed.

## Types of hardware

Toit runs on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) chip from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price/performance out of all the MCUs.
The ESP32 has 520 kB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for e.g. communication protocols (SPI, I2C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, and much more. Its deep-sleep mode allows for extremely low power usage, making it possible to run with two AA batteries for years.

If you don't have an ESP32 yet, you can buy one [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990).

## What you need

- An ESP32 board

- USB cable - USB A / micro USB B

- A computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

- A Toit account

- The Toit CLI installed on your computer

## ESP32 prerequisites


In order to install Toit on an ESP32 microcontroller, it must include at least 4MB of flash and support the following features:


- WiFi to enable the initial connection to the Toit cloud
  

- UART to transmit and receive serial data


<Note type="warning">The ESP32 cannot connect to 5GHz WiFi network.</Note>
