# Web serial connection

Instead of using the Toit CLI for communicating with your hardware via a serial connection, you can also use the
`Serial` menu in the left hand side of the Toit console.

<Note type="warning">

Note that the serial commands available via your web browser in the Toit console are only enabled for 
Chrome and Edge browsers. 

Furthermore, the serial menu is currently in a beta version, ready to be used but with known 
issues to be fixed.

</Note>

Navigate to the `Serial` menu in the Toit console. Plug in your hardware with a USB cable to a serial port on your computer,
and press the `Connect` button. 

In the dialog, choose the serial port you want to connect to via your web browser. 

If the serial connection succeeds and the web serial API detects your hardware correctly, you can now communicate with 
your hardware over the serial connection in your browser.

If the hardware has not been [provisioned](../provision) before with the Toit firmware, settings and hardware ID, the Provision button 
is enabled on the page, and you can start the initial provisioning of your hardware from here instead of using the Toit CLI.

In the provision dialog, set the WiFi credentials for your hardware. The latest released version of the Toit firmware will be installed on the 
hardware by default, unless you choose a different version from the drop down menu.

If the hardware is able to go online during the provisioning process, in other words that the hardware is in the range of the 
WiFi with the credentials given as parameters to the provisioning, then the hardware will be linked to your Toit account and will be visible in the list of devices
when the provision process has finished. 

<Note title="Trouble with web serial?">

If you have trouble with the serial commands in your web browser, or trouble with the serial connection to your hardware, 
please visit the [troubleshooting](../serialport) page. 

Also, if you have problems, try to unplug your hardware from your computer and plug the USB cable into the serial port again, 
and try to connect your hardware again in the browser.

</Note>

The flash button will flash your hardware with the latest released Toit firmware and settings. Flashing is never needed for operating
a Toit device, but can be a great tool for debugging or recovering a lost device. 

If your device is operating as expected, this means that the device is online and connected to the Toit console, 
navigate to the device page in the Toit console where you can continue configuring your device and run Toit code on it, 
monitor logs and much more.
