# Toit SDK

The Toit SDK is the set of development tools needed to develop IoT apps with Toit locally: it contains the Toit compiler, the LSP server and virtual machine. 
It is available from the Toit cloud. When installing the Toit SDK on your computer, you can compile Toit programs locally. 

You can browse the current Toit standard libraries [here](https://libs.toit.io). You can also download the current or previous versions of the SDK examples and libraries from the [Download](https://console.toit.io/download) page in the console.
