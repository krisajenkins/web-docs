# Tutorials

This section contains tutorials to [get started](starter/time) with running Toit code on your device. 

Also, we will show you the difference of running code once on your device and [deploying long-lived Toit apps](starter/temperature) on your device, even when your device is offline and in deep sleep mode.

Later, you can follow this [tutorial](pubsub/pubsubext) that shows how to utilize the Publish/Subscribe service that Toit offers for easy device communication.
