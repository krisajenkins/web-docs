# Bluetooth Low Energy

BLE is short for Bluetooth Low Energy, a communication stack designed specifically for communication between IoT devices
that support BLE.

The BLE stack builds on four simple, but powerful, concepts that can be combined to create a wide range of network topologies:

- **Advertising**: A BLE device can _advertise_ about itself. The advertisement can contain a list of services and a manufactorer data section.

- **Scanning**: A BLE device can _scan_ and _discover_ nearby BLE devices for advertisements.

- **Service**: A BLE service is composed by a list of characteristics, exposed by a BLE device as a _service_.

- **Characteristic**: A BLE service attribute containing a value that may be readable and writable from a _client_.

## Example: Heart rate monitor

If you are using the open source version of [Toit](https://github.com/toitlang/toit) - optionally 
through [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) - you can find a working example in the source 
repository. The example simulates a BLE heart rate monitor and can be 
found [here](https://github.com/toitlang/toit/blob/master/examples/ble/heart_rate.toit).
